#### Brief notes

We felt that this project was a great opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge we have accrued, primarily from the previous semester but also that from our first year, into a practical, real-world setting – By focusing on concepts like requirements engineering and regular widget/black-box/white-box/integration testing while keeping track of robustness, responsiveness and reusability in our code, we quickly managed to adapt to previously unseen frameworks and tools and we hope that you can see this success while navigating through our app.

Approaching this project was wildly different to previous assignments, especially due to the massive emphasis placed on teamwork and independence. As a group of 9, we had to engage in many different activities (consistent communication, high levels of organization using Discord and Trello…). Overall, we all had a great time working together and hope you enjoy our final product!
